 # Blockchain-Based Voting System

A secure and transparent Blockchain-Based Voting System that ensures integrity, anonymity, and immutability of election records. This project leverages blockchain technology to provide a reliable platform for conducting electronic voting with reduced risks of fraud and tampering.

# Features

 Secure Voter Authentication ‚Äì Users can register and log in with unique credentials.

üó≥Ô∏è Vote Casting ‚Äì Easy-to-use interface for selecting and submitting votes.

üîí Encryption with SHA-256 ‚Äì Ensures votes remain anonymous and tamper-proof.

üì¶ Immutable Records ‚Äì Votes are stored in blocks that are linked securely.

üåç Decentralization ‚Äì Eliminates the need for a central authority.

üìä Auditability ‚Äì Results can be verified in real time without compromising voter privacy.

üßë‚Äçü¶Ω Accessibility ‚Äì Voice command feature for users with disabilities.

# System Architecture

  The system consists of the following key modules:

  User Registration & Login ‚Äì Handles voter identity securely.

  Voting Module ‚Äì Allows users to cast their votes.

  Blockchain Module ‚Äì Stores votes in blocks linked with cryptographic hashing.

  Results & Verification ‚Äì Displays transparent results while ensuring anonymity.

  Voice Command Module ‚Äì Provides accessibility for differently-abled users.

# Technologies Used

  Backend: Python (Flask / app.py & service.py)

  Blockchain: Custom implementation using SHA-256 hashing

  Database: JSON file storage for simplicity

  Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

  Voice Commands: SpeechRecognition (Python library)

 # Installation & Setup
  1Ô∏è.Clone the Repository
  git clone https://github.com/mariam0521/Block-Chain-Based-Voting-System-.git

  2.Install Dependencies

   Make sure Python 3.x is installed. Then run:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

  3.Run the Application

    python app.py

    python service.py


The app will start at http://127.0.0.1:5000/

# Experimental Results & Discussion

The system successfully handled secure vote casting without data loss.
Blockchain structure ensured immutability ‚Äì no vote could be altered once stored.
Performance remained stable with up to 500 simulated voters.
Compared with traditional e-voting, the blockchain model increased security, transparency, and trust.

### Below is a sample performance chart:

üìä Example Workflow

  Figure 1: Voting Process in Blockchain-Based Voting System

  Voter registers and logs in.

  Vote is cast and encrypted.

  A new block is generated and added to the chain.

  Votes are stored immutably.

  Results are tallied transparently.
